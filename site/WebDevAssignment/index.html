            <p>"Ready Player One" is a Fictional movie that is centered around the idea of virtual reality.The main character of this movie Wade Watts, an orphan teenager who 
                loves to play this virtual game called "The OASIS", it was created by late James Halladay. Before James passed away he creates a quest/treasure hunt in the game. And whoever find the items hidden will
                have access to a great fortune left behind by James Halladay Himself. Wade, the main character of this story, having a username of "parzival" wins the game along with his friends  Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto.However, the 
                process of winning this challenge was a tough one, as they have to continually battle agains the I0I who have evil motives of taking over the game.All things work in favour of parzival and his friends and they emerge victorious.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another important this to watch out for in the movie is the amazing love between parzival and one of his allies in the game.

            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>"Ready Player One" was a movie i can say was one of my best from 2018, it has a good story line 
             and it's very interesting. Another reason why i loved the movie was how it portrayed the level
                 to which technology can take us, and how it can help connect friends.
